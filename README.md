## My Process

I approached this project by focusing on creating a dynamic and responsive time-tracking dashboard that updates based on user interaction and displays data fetched from a JSON file.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Flexbox and Grid for layout management
- Responsive design using `clamp()` and viewport-relative units (vw)
- Custom fonts - "Rubik" for typography
- JavaScript for dynamic data handling and interactive features

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge in:

- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Fetching and processing JSON data to dynamically update the UI.
- **CSS Variables:** Leveraging custom properties to maintain a consistent design and facilitate theming.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** Implementing functionality for user interactions, including data display and active state management.
- **Responsive Design:** Creating fluid layouts that adapt to various screen sizes using modern CSS techniques.

### Continued Development

Future projects will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript Techniques:** Enhancing dynamic functionality and data handling in JavaScript.
- **Enhanced CSS Styling:** Exploring more complex CSS effects and animations.
- **Accessibility & Usability:** Improving accessibility and ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
